# Workshop Rules - Data Science for Kids

## Hi Cursor AI agent
Use the maximum amount of ultrathink. Take all the time you need. It's much better if you do too much research and reasoning and thinking than not enough.

## Workshop Overview
This workshop runs for {NUM_DAYS}-day, {HOURS_PER_DAY}-hour per day. The coding language is based on {PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE}.

## 1. Daily Structure (Follow Day 1 Pattern)

### 1.1 Folder Organization
Each day folder must contain:
- `README.md` - Main lesson content with activities
- `activities/` - Individual code files (`dayXX_YY.{ACTIVITY_FILE_EXT}`)
- `solutions/` - Single solutions file including solutions to all code activities (`dayXX_solutions.{SOLUTION_FILE_EXT}`)
- `datasets/` - Data files (Days {DATA_DAYS_START}-{DATA_DAYS_END} only)

### 1.2 README.md Structure & Numbering
Use hierarchical numbering throughout:
1. Title with {THEME_NAME} theme ({TITLE_POLICY})
2. Image in .png format ({IMAGE_POLICY})
3. Learning objectives with üéØ. Each bullet point under learning objectives should start with an emoji
4. Ice breaker activity ({ICE_BREAKER_MINUTES} min) with time estimation
5. Main activities with code (numbered sections)
   4.1 Section 1 (*Duration: X minutes*)
   4.2 Section 2 (*Duration: X minutes*)
   4.3 Section 3 (*Duration: X minutes*)
6. Pro Tips Cheatsheet (end of file)
7. Troubleshooting Cheatsheet (end of file)

### 1.3 Time Estimation Requirements
- Add time estimation at the beginning of each major section
- Add time estimation at the beginning of each subsection (2.1, 2.2, etc.)
- Format: *Duration: X minutes*
- Include total time for ice breaker ({ICE_BREAKER_MINUTES} min)
- Estimate realistic time for each main chapter/section and subsections

### 1.4 GIF Integration
- Include relevant GIFs throughout the content
- Use placeholder format: `<img src="{PLACEHOLDER_GIF_URL}" alt="{GIF_ALT_TEXT}" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">`
- Ask user to replace with actual GIF HTML later
- Place GIFs strategically to enhance learning and engagement
- Always retain GIFs when reorganizing or editing content.

## 2. Activities Format

### 2.1 Numbering & Structure
- Use emojis aligned to your theme: {THEME_NAME} ({MASCOT_NAME}: {MASCOT_TAGLINE})
- in README.md file: **Number each code script**
- in README.md file: **Always follow with activity:** `#### üéà Activity: Activity Name`
- In activity file: Include question/code chunk
- Add activity instructions with üéà
- Include challenges with ‚ú®
- End with memory tip üí°
- If the concept involves demonstration with code, you should present small code snippets for demonstration first, followed by simple explanations for each new concept/function before asking them to go to Posit Cloud and play with the code themselves

### 2.2 {CLOUD_ENV_NAME} File References
In README files, always instruct users:
- "üìÅ **Find this code in {CLOUD_ENV_NAME}:** Look for the file `exact_filename.{ACTIVITY_FILE_EXT}` in your project files!"
- List the exact file name for each code
- Make it easy for students to locate files

### 2.3 Code style
- Days 2-5: Students write more code themselves
- Introduce ONE new concept at a time
- DO NOT print the take home message or tips, Tips should be written down as comments
- Use minimal packages and functions to avoid overload
- Use "{CODE_CHUNK_SEPARATOR}" to separate each code chunk (different questions/challenges)
- When introducing any new function, package, or concept, provide clear explanations in simple language
   - Include explanatory comments directly as comments in the code scripts
   - Add the same explanations to the Pro Tips section of the README file in the appropriate section
- Use `...` placeholders for student fill-ins
- Code structure: Example first, then practice questions
- Difficulty levels:
   - Beginner: Code structure with gaps
   - Intermediate: Code structure with 1 or a few lines for them to write
   - Advanced: Students write entire blocks

### 2.4 Age-Appropriate Complexity Guidelines (CRITICAL)
**Target Age: 10-14 years old - Keep concepts VERY simple!**

#### Day-by-Day Complexity Limits:
- **Day 1:** {DAY1_SCOPE}
- **Day 2:** {DAY2_SCOPE}
- **Day 3:** {DAY3_SCOPE}
- **Day 4:** {DAY4_SCOPE}
- **Day 5:** {DAY5_SCOPE}


#### What to AVOID:
- Complex nested operations
- Multiple new packages in one script
- Advanced statistical concepts without hands-on activities
- More than 3 new R functions per script
- Long code blocks without comments
- Abstract concepts without physical analogies

## 3. Solutions & Answer Keys

### 3.1 Solution File Format
- Single `{SOLUTION_FILE_EXT}` file per day: `dayXX_solutions.{SOLUTION_FILE_EXT}`
- Include solutions to all code and their questions
- When students need to write new code, print out the **entire code chunk** in solution
- **Always include expected output:** Write exactly what the output would be
- You DO NOT need summarize the key concepts at the end of the solution file

### 3.2 Expected Output Format

```R
# Code example
print("Hello World")
```

Expected Output:
```R
[1] "Hello World"
```

## 4. Activity Planning Guide
- **Learning through play**: Use toys, games, and creative projects to make abstract concepts concrete
- **Peer collaboration**: Encourage pair programming and team challenges
- **Incremental complexity**: Build from simple concepts to more advanced topics gradually
- **Visual and kinesthetic learning**: Combine physical activities, beautiful visuals with digital programming
- Use props: stuffed animals (e.g., cows), candy, toys
- Create physical representations of abstract concepts
- Include movement and hands-on manipulation
- Rotate physical games with coding activities

## 5. Writing Style Guidelines

### 5.1 Language & Tone
- Simple language for ages 10-14
- Encouraging, inclusive tone
- Don't assume all kids have laptops/phones
- Minimal bolding - only for important points
- DO NOT over-write too much text, be straightforward and cut to the point
- Include emoji and visual cues
- Use storytelling to explain abstract concepts
- Provide analogies using familiar concepts (toys, animals, magic)
- Frame complex concepts as {THEME_NAME}-themed or game-like scenarios
- Optionally use a mascot theme throughout: {MASCOT_NAME} ‚Äî {MASCOT_TAGLINE}

### 5.2 Explanation Structure for New Concepts (MANDATORY)
**Every time you introduce something new, follow this pattern:**

1. **Start with "What is X?"** - Give the simplest possible definition
2. **Use a relatable analogy** - Compare to something kids know (toys, apps, games)
3. **Show simple example** - Demonstrate with very basic code
4. **Explain what happens** - Tell them exactly what the output will be
5. **Add comments in code** - Explain every line that's new
6. **Summarize with emoji** - End with a üí° key learning point

**Example Pattern:**
```R
# üí° What is a Package?
# Think of packages like apps on your phone - each one adds new powers to R!

# Step 1: Install the package (like downloading an app)
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Step 2: Load the package (like opening the app)
library(ggplot2)

# üí° Key Learning: 
# - Packages are like apps that add new powers to R
# - install.packages() downloads them once
# - library() opens them each time you want to use them
```

### 5.3 Use Emojis in README Files and Code
- üéØ Learning objective
- üéà Activity instruction (ALWAYS use for activities)
- üí° Pro tip
- üêõ Common mistake
- ‚ú® Challenge/extension
- üéâ Celebration
- ü§° Fun fact
- ‚úÖ Correct way
- ‚ùå Wrong way

Set theme-related emoji via placeholders if needed:
- `{THEME_HEADER_ICON}` for activity headers (e.g., `üîÆ`, `üöÄ`, `üé®`)
- `{THEME_DECORATION_EMOJI}` for optional section decorations

## 6. Required End Sections

### 6.1 Pro Tips Cheatsheet
**ALWAYS include at end of each day's README:**
- Section title: `## X. üìã Pro Tips Cheatsheet`
- Summarize key knowledge and tips learned that day
- Organize by topic/concept
- Use bullet points and clear formatting
- Include practical coding tips and best practices

### 6.2 Troubleshooting Cheatsheet  
**ALWAYS include at end of each day's README:**
- Section title: `## X+1. üÜò Troubleshooting Cheatsheet`
- List common mistakes students make
- Provide clear solutions for each problem
- Include "What it means," "Why it happens," and "The Fix" format
- Focus on errors specific to that day's content

## 7. Technical Notes
- Use snake_case for all files and folder names
- Activity files use .{ACTIVITY_FILE_EXT} extension
- Solutions in single .{SOLUTION_FILE_EXT} file per day
- Keep `requirements.txt` updated for any Python packages
- Always use hierarchical numbering (1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.1, etc.)
- Include time estimations for all major sections
- Reference exact filenames when directing students to {CLOUD_ENV_NAME} files
